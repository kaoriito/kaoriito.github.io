# Hello! 

I am a health research and data scientist based in Los Angeles. I have a clinical background as a board-certified Occupational Therapist, and I am a freshly minted Ph.D. from the University of Southern California (thesis: _Neural and psychosocial correlates of age-related changes in goal-directed and habitual decision-making_). 

<br />

# Current projects

<details>  
  <summary> Predicting ICU Length of Stay </summary>

<br />

I used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database to predict ICU length of stay, and engineered physician notes (using Bag of Words natural language processing), previous hospital admissions, ICD codes, and demographic data as features in an XGBoost model. 

<br />
<br />
Baseline MSE was improved from 40.44 to 12.13 (test MSE), and baseline MAE was improved from 3.46 to 1.24 (test MAE). I am currently working on improving the model to decrease variance.
